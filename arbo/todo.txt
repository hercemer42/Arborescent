Implement vim style hotkeys, in line editing, new line hotkey etc
    Maybe try duplicating basic vim features first then support other hotkeys
Application install and config folder - move hotkeys config there from a default - have a default config folder
Check for security concerns
    Do we need sanitizing ? Would be annoying because sometimes we'll want to have code in blocks
E2E tests - later
