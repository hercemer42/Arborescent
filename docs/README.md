# Arborescent Documentation

## Quick Start

**1. Create your first tree**

Open Arborescent, press `Ctrl+N` for a new file. Type your first thought and press `Enter` to create branches below it. Use `Tab` to indent (make children) and `Shift+Tab` to outdent.

**2. Declare a context**

Write instructions for an AI in one branch. Right-click it → **Blueprint** → **Declare as Context**. Choose an icon. This context is now reusable anywhere in your tree.

**3. Send work to AI**

Navigate to any branch. Right-click → **Execute** → **In Terminal** (or **In Browser**). Select your context. Your branch content plus the context instructions are sent to the AI.

That's the core loop: decompose your thinking into branches, attach context, send to AI.
