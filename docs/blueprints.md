# Blueprints

Blueprints capture your workflow structure. Export them to share with others, or import community blueprints to jumpstart new projects.

## Adding to a Blueprint

Right-click any branch → **Blueprint** → **Add to Blueprint**. Choose an icon and color.

The branch becomes part of your blueprint. Its ancestors are automatically included (a blueprint must form a connected path to the root).

To include descendants too: **Blueprint** → **Add with Descendants**.

Blueprint branches display custom icons instead of checkboxes. Click the icon to change it.

## Blueprint Mode

Toggle with `Ctrl+Shift+B` or **View** → **Blueprint Mode**.

Blueprint mode filters the tree to show only blueprint branches. This helps you focus on structure without content clutter. New branches created in this mode are automatically blueprints.

## Exporting

**File** → **Export as Blueprint** saves only the blueprint branches to a new `.arbo` file.

Share this file with your team or community. It contains your workflow structure—contexts, organization, icons—without your working content.

## Importing

**File** → **Import from Blueprint** creates a new document from a blueprint file.

The imported structure becomes your starting point. Fill in the content branches while the blueprint structure guides your workflow.

## Context Declarations

[Contexts](contexts.md) are a special type of blueprint. When you declare a context, the branch and its descendants automatically become blueprints.

Context declaration branches show their icon both in place of the checkbox and in the gutter.

## Removing from Blueprint

Right-click → **Blueprint** → **Remove from Blueprint**.

If the branch has blueprint descendants, you'll be asked whether to remove them too.
